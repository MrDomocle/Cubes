## 3D Cube animator
This website creates a matrix of cubes which can be animated, similar to the small cubes in the [Nintendo GameCube menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIP602rRWvQ).  
I am one of the organisers for Scrapyard Bangkok, and this was written as decoration for its upcoming website.  

It's compatible with game of life pattern formats - paste the pattern code when you're in the tab and watch the thing you copied fly in.  
To draw something yourself, you can go either to [my own Game of Life website](https://domocle.neocities.org/GameOfLife), or to [ConwayLife](https://conwaylife.com). In both you can make a selection of the pattern, then press Ctrl+C (or whatever combo copies text in your OS) and paste the pattern in the animator.
